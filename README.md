# barcode
This C++ library generates and displays barcodes for various applications. It supports UPC and Code 39 formats, converting numerical or alphanumeric data into a string of '1's and '0's. These strings are then rendered as console-based bar-and-space patterns, making it easy to visualize and verify barcodes directly in the terminal.
